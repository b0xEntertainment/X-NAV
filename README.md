# X-NAV
Control your Windows PC with your XInput compatible controller!

This program gets XInput variables and turns them to WINAPI functions.
Also contains a managing window the user can interact with.
Manual key bindings in the program are not present and most likely won't be done because it was just a fun project.
But thought it would be worth to publish the source code :)
